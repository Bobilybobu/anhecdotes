                Welcome to the final chapter of my story. Although passionate about art and engineering, I am equally driven by a deep empathy for those who are underprivileged, disabled, and lack access to educational resources. Beyond a keen engineer and photographer, I also take pride as a volunteer teacher, donor, and advocate for the deaf and mute community. This is a side of me that goes beyond education and recreation, and more humane and personal to my heart.

                The deaf and mute community is something I recently explored. From a survey conducted with my core team, 91.4% of respondents admitted to having little knowledge about the community, and 89.1% confessed they knew little or nothing about sign language. This underscores a significant gap in awareness and communication skills when it comes to interacting with the deaf. <br><br>
That’s why I aim to represent and convey the essence of this community through my photography—creating images that transcend the senses and resonate with people's hearts, bringing greater awareness to the ASL community. <br><br>
I also really like children. That is why when I see underprivileged children in mountainous areas with poor living and studying conditions, it fuels my motivation to do voluntary work to make a difference in their lives.

                Since the start of highschool, I have been working as a voluntary teacher in rural ares of the country. I plan, organize lessons, and think of creative and fun games for the class. My goal is to create a learning environment where students, regardless of their circumstances, can enjoy the beauty of knowledge and have equal opportunities as their peers.

                Also, as someone who loves art and photography, I want to show children how to be creative and the transformative power of art. I want them to help them express themselves, explore new perspectives, and view the beautiful world through the same lens that I do.

                And by donating, teaching, and connecting with these children, I’m rewarded with the sight of their bright smiles, a reflection of the impact we can make together.
