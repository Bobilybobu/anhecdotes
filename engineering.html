            <p class="lead">
              It all began with a simple, playful zombie-shooting Scratch game made by a curious 6th grader. Mesmerized
              by the idea of playing my own creation—and even being able to "hack" it—I embarked on my coding journey.
              Little did I know that a few years later, I would be coding robots and working with university students in
              one of Hanoi’s leading tech universities.
              <br><br>
              The experience has been nothing short of incredible, full of surprises at every turn. And yet, this is
              just the beginning of my engineering journey.

              </h2>
            </div>
            <p class="lead">
              This is ABB’s Dual-arm YuMi collaborative robot. It features two articulated arms that can work together
              seamlessly, allowing for intricate tasks such as assembly, packaging, and handling delicate components.
              Each arm has up to seven degrees of freedom, enabling the robotic arms to perform complex tasks with high
              precision and dexterity, similar to the movements of a human arm.
              <br><br>
              It comes with a pendant that can control the robotic arm through a simple joystick. Additionally, the
              robot includes a unique function that allows users to manually position the arm at specific points,
              effectively “teaching” it those locations. This capability makes it easy to obtain the coordinates needed
              for programming tasks, streamlining the setup process and enhancing usability.

          My proudest achievement is my creation of a RAPID-based program for ABB’s Dual-arm YuMi collaborative robot
          which automatically sorts tomatoes based on ripeness. This accomplishment isn’t an overnight effort; it’s the
          culmination of months of intensive learning and trial.
          <br><br>
          Unlike the games and websites I’d programmed before where problems had straightforward solutions, the real
          world presents uncontrollable factors that require a more innovative approach. Through countless trials, I
          improved the robot’s ability to grasp differently-shaped tomatoes and the accuracy of the robot’s judgments.
          <br><br>
          Through this project, I aim to use the knowledge gained during my time as a student to approach global
          technology trends. Several development directions could make the product sorting and automated storage system
          more efficient and better meet the needs of businesses and the market. AI and machine learning can be applied
          to predict storage demand and consumer trends, optimizing the arrangement and storage of goods. Leveraging the
          system's self-learning capabilities can continuously improve performance and adaptability over time. The
          automated storage system can also be integrated with order and delivery processes, reducing time and costs
          related to transportation.
          <br><br>
          In conclusion, the project achieved several successes, such as designing a model of an automated product
          sorting and storage system using the Yumi robot to move products, and applying IoT technology for remote
          control and monitoring of the system. A real product model was constructed, programmed for control, and
          monitored to ensure stable and accurate operation.

            First time interacting with such an expensive piece of equipment, I was mesmerized by how intricate the

            The coordinates were determined through manual jogging and recorded by hand. Though no coding was involved,
