            </div>
            <p class="lead">
              I started photography at 14 years old when my dad gave me the FUJIFILM X-T2, my first digital camera. I
              began by taking photos of my friends and family and was immediately in love. Over the two years of owning
              the camera, I ventured into various genres, from street and macro photography to my current focus on
              conceptual photography. I have taken over 50,000 photos and spent hundreds of hours in Lightroom. However,
              my biggest achievement in photography is completing my photo library "INNER REFLECTIONS," which consists
              of nine albums and follows the theme of Greek gods and deadly sins to portray human emotions.
              <br><br>
              Through the lens of my camera, I capture the raw essence of human emotion,
              unveiling the hidden layers of my own soul. Photography has become my silent symphony, where each image
              resonates with the profound and often shadowed emotions I have experienced.

          <h3>LOVE</h3>
          <h3>/ləv/</h3>
          <p class="post-caption">Love is a breath-taking thing. It keeps me awake at night, my thoughts filled with her
            even in my dreams. I long for her touch, her voice, and the warmth of her affection. Love to me is a emotion
            beyond describing—powerful and full of wonder. That’s why I poured my heart into capturing my love for her
            in my album, <i>Aphrodite: Love</i>. Through every image, I strive to express what words can’t—the depth, the
            beauty, and the mystery of what love means to me.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="post-caption">The model in the pictures had her face out of the frame as to symbolize that love is
            deeply personal. It’s my way of saying that love is experienced uniquely by everyone. Whether it's the love
            between opposite genders, the bond of friendship, brotherhood, or the warmth of motherhood—love takes
            countless forms, each meaningful in its own way. </p>
          <br>
          <p class="post-caption">The rose, which appears in nearly every picture, symbolizes love in its purest form.
            Yet, love is not solely beautiful; it can also be painful, much like the rose’s thorns. While most of my
            memories of her are filled with beauty and joy, some evoke a bittersweet ache that lingers in my heart.

    <!-- RAGE POST-->

          <h3>RAGE</h3>
          <h3>/rāj/</h3>
          <p class="post-caption">I unleash my anger as a form of rage. Rage blinds my vision, and puts me in a state of
            chaotic madness, skewing my judgement. This fury stems from the pressures of school, the weight of exam
            results, peer expectations, and countless other stresses that build up within me. Whenever I feel
            inadequate, rage erupts as screams and expressions of hatred. My album, <i>Ares: Rage</i> captures these moments,
            serving as a canvas where I can confront my turmoil.
            <br><br>
            All three pictures were taken in red lighting with low exposure, with bright highlights on the model’s skin,
            capturing the raw essense of rage and anger. The color red not only represents anger, but also danger,
            implying that unleashing the rage within can ultimately harm oneself, as illustrated by the blood on the
            model’s hand, a poignant reminder of the pain that comes from internal conflict.
            <br><br>
            The second picture was inspired by “The fallen angel” by Alexander Cabanel. The concept of “The fallen
            angel” often symbolizes a being that has succumbed to darker emotions, in this case, rage. “The fallen
            angel” reflects the impact of rage on one’s identity, suggesting that giving in to rage could alter them,
            pulling them into darkness and distorting who they once were.

          <h3>ECSTACY AND LIBERATION</h3>
          <h3>/ˈekstəsē/ and /ˌlibəˈrāSH(ə)n/</h3>
          <p class="post-caption">This <i>Dionysus: Ecstasy and Liberation</i> album is deeply personal to me because instead of
            being behind the camera, I was in front of it, modelling the first time ever in my life. It was truly a
            perspective changing experience as a conceptual photographer.
            <br>
            <br>
            Through this experience, I learned how to pose and express emotions, discovering just how challenging it can
            be to follow a photographer's choreography and instructions. This created a profound understanding and
            appreciation for my previous models that I worked with in the past, enhancing myself to guide them more
            effectively in the future. I am looking forward to modelling in future albums, aiming to gain more
            experience in photography.
            <br>
            <br>
            Dionysus symbolizes emotional liberation, the release of repressed feelings, and embodies the chaotic and
            frenzied side of human nature. By stepping out of my comfort zone and immersing myself in a state of total
            ecstasy creative flow, I have allowed myself to portray the greek god as authentic and deeply meaningful as
            possible. Thus, the tittle of the album: Ecstasy and Liberation.

    <!-- GRIEF POST-->

          <h3>GRIEF</h3>
          <h3>/ɡrēf/</h3>
          <p class="post-caption">This year, I lost a family member on a cold winter day. His passing was sudden,
            leaving behind only memories and sobbing family members. Grief is present in many people, especially at the
            death of their loved ones. <i>Hades: Grief and Sorrow</i> encapsulates the altitude of my sadness at his depature.
            <br>
            <br>
            Hades, often associated with the god of the Underwold, is an immortal figure untouched by human emotion.
            Yet, in my album, Hades becomes the vessel for expressing profound grief. Though seldom thought of this way,
            as the god who rules the dead, Hades is tied to human grief. He embodies the permanence and inevitability of
            death, making the symbol of ultimate mourning.
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition, In Greek Mythology, Hades is fated to be separated with his beloved wife, Persephone. The
            skulls in the photos could be seen as symbols of Persephone—depicting sorrow and grief, even in death
            himself, conveying an ironic, nearly laughable story. Perhaps it is just a way for me to cope, finding
            solace through laughing in the face of death.
